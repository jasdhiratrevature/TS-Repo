# Method Decorators
A Method Decorator is used to decorate a class method. The method decorator is applied to the Property Descriptor for that method.

The method decorator receives three arguments.

- The prototype of the class for an instance member OR the constructor function of the class for a static member.
- The name of the method.
- The Property Descriptor for the method.
